#### Briefly about me:
At the moment I am taking a course from Rolling scores school to become a programmer. I chose this profession because I want to create something, but I do not have an aptitude for any kind of art. I hope that with the help of FrontEnd development course I can become a sought-after professional.
#### Skils:
I know syntax of Python and C
#### Example of code:
Implement the trim_and_repeat() function, which takes three parameters: the string, offset - the number of characters by which to trim the string to the left and repetitions - the number of times it should be repeated, and returns the resulting string. The default number of characters to cut is 0, and repetitions is 1.

```
def trim_and_repeat(text, offset=0, repetitions=1):
    return text[offset:] * repetitions
```
